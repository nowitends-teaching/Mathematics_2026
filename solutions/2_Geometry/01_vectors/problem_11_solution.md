### Exercise 11. Decomposition into Parallel and Perpendicular Components

Decompose $u=(3,4)$ into components parallel and perpendicular to $v=(1,2)$. Check

$$
u=u_{\parallel}+u_{\perp},\qquad u_{\perp}\cdot v=0.
$$

Explain why these are two independent checks of correctness.

> **Why this exercise:** deepens the idea of projection through construction and verification.

## Solution

The parallel component is the projection:

$$
u_{\parallel}=\frac{u\cdot v}{v\cdot v}v=\frac{11}{5}(1,2)=\left(\frac{11}{5},\frac{22}{5}\right).
$$

Subtracting it from $u$ gives

$$
u_{\perp}=u-u_{\parallel}=\left(\frac45,-\frac25\right).
$$

The reconstruction check is

$$
u_{\parallel}+u_{\perp}=\left(\frac{15}{5},\frac{20}{5}\right)=(3,4)=u,
$$

while the orthogonality check is

$$
u_{\perp}\cdot v=\frac45-\frac45=0.
$$

Reconstruction checks that no component of $u$ was lost; the dot product separately checks that the residual has the required perpendicular direction. Either condition alone would not establish both facts.
